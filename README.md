# 🚬 Smoking Detection

**Smoking Detection** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a person is a smoker or non-smoker based on various features. The model is trained on structured data and can be used for health research, risk analysis, or educational purposes.

### 1. 📁 Project Structure
```
- smoking_data.csv         # Dataset containing features and smoking labels
- smoking_detection.ipynb  # Main Jupyter notebook with data analysis & ML pipeline
- requirements.txt         # List of required Python packages
- .gitignore               # Files and folders to ignore in Git
```

### 2. 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smoking-no-smoking.git
cd smoking-no-smoking

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # For Unix/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate        # For Windows

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. 🧠 Technologies Used
```
- Python 3.11
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
```

### 4. 📊 Features & Workflow
In the `smoking_detection.ipynb` notebook, the following steps are implemented:
```
- Load and explore the dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation
- Train/test split
- Machine learning model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Final prediction output
```

### 5. 🧪 Example Features (columns in dataset)
```
- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Blood Pressure
- Physical Activity
- Alcohol Consumption
- ... and more
```

### 6. 📌 Notes
- The dataset is used solely for educational and research purposes.
- Model performance will vary based on feature selection and data quality.
- Can be extended with deep learning or deployed as a web app in the future.
